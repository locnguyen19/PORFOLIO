          I'm currently a third-year student in Haaga-Helia University of Applied Sciences studying to become a full- stack web developer and software developer.

          Programming has truly been my passion for a while now and I really like solving problems with designing and coding. I also enjoy desiging webs and seeing my work/code come to life. In addition, I am also into the analytical and mathematical approach that coding will successfully deal with practical challenges.
          </p>
          <p className="hero--section-description" >
          At the moment I'm really into full-stack web development. Most of my coding is done using TypeScript/JavaScript, Python and of course necessary HTML/CSS.
